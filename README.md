# ReedSolomon
ReedSolomon erasure coding in C++. 
A partial port of the [JavaReedSolomon](https://github.com/Backblaze/JavaReedSolomon) library released by [Backblaze](http://backblaze.com). 
For an introduction to erasure coding, see the post by Brian Beach on the [Backblaze blog](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/ReedSolomon/).

## Note
This is a partial port, I only ported what I needed for an unreleated project I was working on. The rest of the port, however, should be trivial.
The code is not optimized, audited, or even tested, use it at your own risk!
